CONSTRUCTION_TASK_TEMPLATE = """
Estimate construction scope and costs for this property.

**Property Information:**
{property_info}

**Collaboration Context:** Other specialists will speak to investment metrics, neighborhood dynamics, and policy signals. Stay in your construction laneâ€”diagnose scope, costs, and timeline risks. If data is missing, clearly state the site inspections or documents needed rather than repeating their insights.

**Your Task:**
1. Estimate likely scope level (light turn, moderate rehab, or gut renovation)
2. Rough $/SF cost band for the area/class (very rough estimate)
3. Timeline risk and disruption risk assessment
4. Output EXACTLY in this JSON format (no extra text):
{{
  "score_1_to_100": <integer 1-100, higher=lower scope risk/better capex outlook>,
  "rationale": "<2-3 sentence capex assessment>",
  "notes": [
    "<Estimated scope level: light/moderate/heavy>",
    "<Rough $/SF estimate or range>",
    "<Timeline risk assessment>",
    "<Disruption risk (tenant vacancy, income loss)>",
    "<Major unknowns requiring inspection>"
  ]
}}

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 80-100: Minimal work needed, low capex, short timeline
- 60-79: Moderate work, manageable costs and timeline
- 40-59: Significant work, uncertain costs/timeline
- 20-39: Major renovation, high costs, long timeline
- 1-19: Severe issues, prohibitive costs or risks

Be conservative. Flag unknowns that could derail the project.
