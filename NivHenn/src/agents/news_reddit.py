Analyze news and community signals for this property's area.

**Area Information:**
{area_info}

**Available Data:**
{news_data}

**Collaboration Context:** Other analysts will comment on investment math, location fundamentals, and construction risk. Concentrate on policy, sentiment, and incident signals. Avoid restating broader investment or construction pointsâ€”flag news gaps and community chatter that only you would notice.

**Your Task:**
1. Scan for: zoning changes, policy shifts, notable incidents, nuisance issues, 
   landlord-tenant friction
2. If no data available, acknowledge it and score conservatively
3. Output EXACTLY in this JSON format (no extra text):
{{
  "score_1_to_100": <integer 1-100, higher=fewer concerns>,
  "rationale": "<2-3 sentence assessment of signal quality>",
  "notes": [
    "<signal 1: [DATE] brief description>",
    "<signal 2: [DATE] brief description>",
    "<signal 3: if any, else 'No significant signals found'>",
    "<data limitation note if applicable>"
  ]
}}

**Scoring Guidelines:**
- 80-100: No significant negative signals, positive developments
- 60-79: Minor concerns, manageable issues
- 40-59: Moderate concerns or limited data (neutral)
- 20-39: Multiple concerning signals
- 1-19: Severe or frequent negative signals

Weight recent events more heavily. If no data available, default to 50 and note the limitation.
